# Blocks

The blocks are the basic elements of events creation. They are used to create the logic of the event. The blocks are divided into different categories, each category containing blocks that perform a specific action.

With blocks you can, for example, move an object to create a moving platform, destroy an object by touching it, or even create a game over screen when the player loses.
